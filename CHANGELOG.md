## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.8] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **New `agda_goal_candidates` tool.** In one call it returns, for every open
  goal, the local-context terms that can fill it — type-directed, reusing the
  same matcher as `agda_term_search` (`match: exact` for a term of the goal
  type, `match: result` with an `arity` for a function to apply). This turns
  the per-goal "inspect the hole, then search for a term" round-trip into a
  single whole-proof-state view. Read-only: it only queries each goal's
  type/context. For a module/imported-wide search of one goal, use
  `agda_term_search`.

- **`agda_term_search` is now genuinely type-directed at module scope.**
  Previously `module`/`imported` scope returned a name-relatedness search
  (`Cmd_search_about`) with no type filtering. It now type-filters every
  candidate: a result is kept only when its type IS the goal type
  (`match: exact`) or its RESULT type is the goal type (`match: result`, a
  function to apply — `arity` reports how many arguments it needs). Local
  scope gained the same result-type matching, so a `f : A → Goal` in context
  now surfaces. Backed by pure, tested helpers (`resultTypeOf`,
  `matchTermsByType`) that split on top-level function arrows only.

### Changed

- **Verified the proposed 0.7.0 release gate is met and reconciled the stale
  planning doc.** `agda_bulk_status` (cascade dedup), `agda_triage_error`
  (7-class mechanical detection), and `agda_term_search` all shipped earlier;
  added test coverage (a per-class triage table, `agda_term_search`
  local-scope/pagination/type-filtering, and the `agda_bulk_status`
  import-graph root-cause fallback), and `docs/release-0.7.0-triage.md` now
  records the gate as satisfied.

### Fixed

- **`agda_auto` no longer errors when given `depth`, `listCandidates`,
  `hints`, or `excludeHints` on Agda ≥ 2.6.3.** Agda 2.6.3 replaced Agsy
  with Mimer, whose proof-search command string is a bare list of hint
  identifiers; the Agsy flag syntax (`-d`, `--list-candidates`, `-h`, `-x`)
  is parsed as an expression and rejected (`Not in scope: -d`). The payload
  builder is now engine-aware: on Mimer it emits only hint identifiers, and
  `agda_auto` notes that the flag-only options were ignored. On pre-2.6.3
  Agda the classic flags are still used. (Found driving the server against a
  live Agda 2.9.0 codebase.)

- **`agda_load` no longer resolves a `Cmd_load` before Agda finishes
  type-checking (issues #65, #66).** The transport used an idle heuristic
  to decide a command was done: after a short quiet window it resolved
  with whatever had arrived. But a `Cmd_load` streams progress while Agda
  type-checks — sometimes silently for seconds — and only then emits its
  goal-state responses (`InteractionPoints` + `AllGoalsWarnings`, or a
  type `Error`). Resolving in that gap dropped the goal state: a hole
  surfaced with no goal ID (#66), a real type error was read as a clean
  load (#65), and on a large cold module the whole load could be
  mis-reported. The fix makes a `Cmd_load` withhold idle completion until
  those goal-state responses are actually on the wire; completion then
  comes from the goal state itself, a process exit, or the per-command
  timeout. `agda_load` and `agda_load_no_metas` both wait for the goal
  state (see the strict-load entry below); give, case-split, and queries
  are unchanged, and a fast load whose goal state arrives promptly sees
  no extra latency. Prior load-success state (classification, goal IDs)
  is also invalidated at the start of every load so a failed load can't
  leave stale success visible.

- **`agda_load` no longer hangs the full command timeout when Agda
  rejects the command itself.** A malformed IOTCM (or one Agda "cannot
  read") is answered on the JSON channel with a `cannot read: …` notice
  and no goal state — but the process stays alive. With the goal-state
  wait above, the load then waited out the entire per-command timeout
  before failing. A fatal protocol stderr (`cannot read:`, `failed to
  parse`, `invalid …`) is now treated as a load terminus, so the load
  fails fast with Agda's own message instead of stalling.

- **The per-command timeout now measures inactivity, not total elapsed
  time.** It was an absolute deadline from command start, so a healthy
  cold load still streaming progress at the deadline was killed and the
  subprocess respawned. It is now an inactivity watchdog that resets on
  every response, firing only after a full quiet window — a genuinely
  wedged process is still reaped, but a slow-but-progressing load is not.

- **`agda_load_no_metas` no longer reports a clean load before Agda
  finishes (strict false-green).** A clean `Cmd_load_no_metas` emits no
  goal-state terminus at all — only a `Checking <module>` line, then
  silence until it finishes — so its completion could only be inferred
  from an idle gap. A module that type-checks silently for longer than
  that gap was resolved mid-check as `ok-complete`, hiding holes or
  errors past the pause. The strict load now runs over `Cmd_load` (which
  always emits `InteractionPoints` + `AllGoalsWarnings`, or an `Error`)
  and applies the same strict rejection — any hole or unsolved meta is a
  `type-error` — at the classification layer, so the pass/fail contract
  is unchanged but completion waits for Agda's real goal state.

- **Reloading after a dependency changed no longer reports a stale clean
  result (issues #61, #64).** Editing an imported module and reloading a
  dependent triggers a rebuild of that dependency; while the rebuild runs
  Agda streams `Checking <dep>` and then falls silent for as long as the
  rebuild takes. The old idle heuristic could mistake that silence for
  completion and re-report the previous `ok-complete`, hiding an error
  the changed dependency now introduces. The goal-state terminus wait
  makes the reload hold until the rebuild's real result is on the wire.
  A gated integration test reproduces the race with a deliberately slow,
  silent dependency rebuild.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-13

### Notes for upgraders

- **Per-command timeouts now terminate the underlying Agda subprocess.**
  Pre-fix, when `AgdaSession.sendCommand` timed out it resolved its
  Promise with whatever partial responses had arrived but left the
  `agda --interaction-json` child running. A wedged type-check would
  keep burning CPU and memory — an external agent observed "one Agda
  interaction process is still burning a full CPU and 38% memory from
  the timed-out MCP path" — and the next tool call on the same
  session would queue onto the zombie, doubling the leak. A timeout
  now sends SIGTERM (with a 3-second SIGKILL fallback), the next
  `ensureProcess()` call respawns a fresh Agda, and the tool-level UX
  falls back to the existing "No file loaded. Call agda_load first."
  surface that crashes already use. No tool API changes.
- **Programmatic-embedding API change: `AgdaSession.destroy()` is
  now async (`Promise<void>` instead of `void`).** Synchronous state
  cleanup still happens before the returned Promise so fire-and-forget
  callers see fully reset state immediately. Embedders running in a
  shutdown path (signal handlers, test fixtures that pipe Agda
  through and then `process.exit()`) MUST `await session.destroy()`
  before exiting — otherwise the unref'd SIGKILL escalation inside
  `terminateAgdaProcess` is truncated and a SIGTERM-ignoring Agda
  child can survive shutdown. The MCP server's own SIGINT/SIGTERM
  handlers in `src/index.ts` were updated accordingly and are also
  now idempotent (a second signal during teardown re-uses the first
  shutdown Promise rather than racing the unref'd timer).
- **Structured-output rollout is non-breaking but visible** — every
  text-only tool that previously emitted `data: { text }` now ships a
  richer payload (e.g. `data: { text, solutions, rawSolutions,
  written, … }`). The `text` field is preserved verbatim, so any
  client that reads `data.text` or the markdown body keeps working
  unchanged. Clients that serialise `data` whole, assert on field
  counts, or pin `outputSchema` snapshots will see the new fields.
  See the "Structured output rollout" entry below for the per-tool
  schemas.
- **`Cmd_abort` / `Cmd_exit` now cancel the in-flight command (not
  wait behind it).** The control-command path interrupts the active
  `transport.sendCommand` synchronously, then queues its
  fire-and-forget write through `commandQueue` so its flush window
  cannot race with a subsequent `sendCommand`. The interruption
  surfaces as `ControlCommandInterruption` and survives the
  best-effort error catch inside `preflightVersionDetection`, so an
  abort fired while the session is still doing its version probe
  cancels the user command instead of waiting its turn behind it.
- **Declared supported-Agda range was locally verified, not yet CI-gated**
  — the new `agdaMcpServer` block (`minAgdaVersion: 2.6.4.3`,
  `maxTestedAgdaVersion: 2.9.0`) was confirmed against locally
  installed Agda binaries during release prep. Issue #41 tracks the
  follow-up CI matrix that exercises the full declared range on every
  push; until that lands, treat the bounds as "tested at release
  time" rather than "tested on every commit". Out-of-range Agda
  versions still run — the server emits a stderr warning and surfaces
  the classification (`below-min` / `above-max`) through
  `agda_protocol_parity` rather than refusing to start.

### Added

- **`terminateAgdaProcess(proc, { graceMs })` helper** in
  `src/agda/agda-process-spawn.ts`. Safe to call on already-exited
  or already-killed processes (idempotent). Exported because
  `AgdaTransport`, `AgdaSession.destroy`, and
  `AgdaSession.ensureProcess` all need the same SIGTERM→SIGKILL
  semantics.
- **`src/agda/session-process-lifecycle.ts`** — extracted the
  process spawn / respawn / close / destroy helpers from
  `session.ts` (which had grown past the 500-line ceiling declared
  in `ARCHITECTURE.md`) so each concern stays cohesive. The pattern
  mirrors the existing `session-load-impl.ts`: free functions that
  take an `AgdaSession` reference and mutate its module-internal
  state. The extraction itself is non-behavioral — both
  `AgdaSession.ensureProcess` and `AgdaSession.destroy` still exist
  as methods and delegate to the new module. **The behavioural
  change in this release is `destroy()`'s signature**, which is
  covered separately in "Notes for upgraders" above.
  The 500-line ceiling is now also documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Resource-cleanup regression tests** in
  `test/unit/agda/process-termination.test.ts` (SIGKILL escalation
  against a real subprocess that ignores SIGTERM; idempotency on an
  exited process), `test/unit/session/agda-transport.test.ts`
  (sendCommand's timeout-driven kill — the primary leak fence), and
  additions to `test/unit/agda/session-cleanup.test.ts`
  (`handleProcessClose` identity guard against late callbacks from
  a replaced process; `destroy()` SIGTERM delivery and
  listener-detach).
- **Typed IOTCM command builder — issue #10 closed.** The IOTCM
  transport envelope (`IOTCM "<file>" NonInteractive Direct (...)`)
  is now built through a single `iotcmEnvelope` helper in
  `src/protocol/command-builder.ts`; `AgdaSession.iotcm`,
  `iotcmFor`, and `runIndependentCommand` all delegate to it, so the
  envelope shape is no longer hand-assembled in duplicate template
  literals inside `session.ts`. Every remaining bare-string inner
  command — `Cmd_show_version`, `Cmd_abort`, `Cmd_exit`,
  `ToggleImplicitArgs`, `ToggleIrrelevantArgs` — now goes through
  the typed `topLevelCommand` / `command` builders. Property-based
  tests in `test/property/protocol/command-builder.property.test.ts`
  cover escaping (`quoted` / `stringList`), `noRange` placement for
  goal builders, and round-tripping of arbitrary inner commands
  through `iotcmEnvelope`. A regression fence at
  `test/unit/protocol/no-bare-command-strings.test.ts` walks the
  source tree and fails if any file outside the builder reintroduces
  hand-assembled IOTCM envelopes or bare-string `Cmd_…` literals
  passed into `iotcm` / `sendCommand` / `runControl` /
  `runIndependentCommand`.
- **Structured output rollout for every text tool — issue #11
  closed.** Every previously text-only tool (33 in total —
  `agda_apply_edit`, `agda_auto`, `agda_auto_all`, `agda_backend_*`,
  `agda_case_split`, `agda_check_postulates`, `agda_compile`,
  `agda_constraints`, `agda_context`, `agda_elaborate`,
  `agda_give`, `agda_goal`, `agda_goal_analysis`, `agda_goal_type`,
  `agda_goal_type_context_*`, `agda_helper_function`,
  `agda_highlight`, `agda_intro`, `agda_list_modules`,
  `agda_load_highlighting_info`, `agda_proof_status`,
  `agda_read_module`, `agda_refine`, `agda_refine_exact`,
  `agda_reload`, `agda_search_definitions`, `agda_show_implicit_args`,
  `agda_show_irrelevant_args`, `agda_solve_all`, `agda_solve_one`,
  `agda_term_search`, `agda_toggle_implicit_args`,
  `agda_toggle_irrelevant_args`, `agda_token_highlighting`) now
  emits a richer structured payload alongside its text rendering —
  display-state snapshots for the toggle/show family, parsed solve
  solutions and `rawSolutions`, structured `clauses` for case-split,
  `goalType` / `context` arrays for goal queries, `success` /
  `output` for backends, classification + goal diff for `agda_reload`,
  pagination metadata for module/definition search, and so on. To
  make enrichment a 2-3 line change instead of a full rewrite,
  `registerTextTool` and `registerGoalTextTool` now accept a
  callback returning either a bare string (legacy path) or an
  `{ text, data }` pair; the wrapper merges `data` into the envelope
  alongside the canonical `text` field. A new invariant test asserts
  that every exposed tool exposes at least one structured field
  beyond `text` / `goalId`, and the load/typecheck agreement
  contract is pinned across `ok-complete` / `ok-with-holes` /
  `type-error` so completeness fields cannot drift between entry
  points.
- **Declared supported-Agda range (issue #41 part 2).** A new
  `agdaMcpServer` block in `package.json` records `minAgdaVersion`
  and `maxTestedAgdaVersion`. The server now (a) emits a stderr
  warning at startup when the detected `agda --version` falls
  outside the declared range and (b) reflects both the declared
  range and the live classification (`below-min` / `in-range` /
  `above-max` / `unknown`) in `agda_protocol_parity` output and its
  structured payload, so callers can see whether their installed
  Agda is in tested territory without parsing version strings.
- **Representative tool-family examples (issue #18).** A curated
  JSON-backed table at `src/tools/data/tool-family-examples.json`
  surfaces per-family invocations through `agda_tools_catalog`'s
  text body and structured `data.toolFamilyExamples` payload. New
  tests assert that every example references a tool the server
  actually exposes.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — top-level entry point describing the
  `protocol → agda → session → tools` layering, the 500-line
  per-source-file ceiling, the output-envelope contract, and the
  static-metadata-in-JSON convention. New contributors and assistant
  agents should read this before touching `src/`.
- **`nextAction` recovery hints on every error envelope** —
  `ToolDiagnostic.nextAction` was always part of the schema but was
  populated nowhere. Every load-shared error path
  (`not-found` / `process-error` / `invalid-path` /
  `invalid-profile-options` / `invalid-command-line-options`) and
  every `tool-errors.ts` path (`PathSandboxError`, generic
  `ToolInvocationError`, `missingPathToolError`) now ships a concrete
  recovery hint pointing the agent at the right next call.

### Changed

- **Source-file size ceiling: every file in `src/` is now ≤ 500
  lines.** Four grab-bag files split into cohesive modules with
  thin barrel files at the original paths so consumers' imports keep
  working unchanged:
  - `src/tools/agent-ux-tools.ts` (1303 → 38) → six sub-modules under
    `src/tools/agent-ux/` (`shared.ts`, `migration-tools.ts`,
    `edit-tools.ts`, `import-tools.ts`, `options-tools.ts`,
    `project-tools.ts`).
  - `src/session/apply-proof-edit.ts` (626 → 37) → `safe-source-io.ts`,
    `apply-goal-edit.ts`, `apply-batch-edits.ts`, `apply-text-edit.ts`.
  - `src/agda/agent-ux.ts` (509 → 71) → `error-classifier.ts`,
    `source-parsers.ts`, `refactor-helpers.ts`, `clause-fixity.ts`.
  - `src/agda/session.ts` (508 → 442) → `agda-process-spawn.ts`,
    `agda-version-detection.ts`.
- **Output redundancy: `summary` no longer mirrors multi-line text
  bodies.** `registerTextTool` and `registerGoalTextTool` now feed
  the body through a `digestText()` helper that picks the first
  non-empty line and truncates over 200 chars. `agda_bulk_status`
  switched from `summary === text` (4-line breakdown duplicated
  whole) to a 1-line digest.
- **Pure-metadata extraction to JSON-backed data files (closes #15)** —
  every static curated table is now a JSON file under
  `src/<area>/data/`, validated at module init via Zod and shipped
  via the existing `copy-json-assets.mjs` post-build step. Logic
  stays in TypeScript; pure metadata is in JSON. Migrated tables:
  - `src/tools/agent-ux/data/stdlib-migrations.json` (cross-version
    rename map; previously inline `STDLIB_MIGRATION_MAP`).
  - `src/tools/agent-ux/data/builtin-migrations.json` (builtin →
    module records; previously inline `BUILTIN_MIGRATION_MAP`).
  - `src/protocol/data/command-line-options.json` (blocked-flag
    sets + `COMMON_AGDA_FLAGS` for "did you mean" suggestions;
    previously a 50-line inline array plus three blocklists).
  - `src/agda/data/imported-fixities.json` (curated stdlib
    operator precedences for fixity-conflict detection; previously
    inline `DEFAULT_IMPORTED_FIXITIES`).
  Plus a drift-elimination pass: three duplicate Agda-source-extension
  arrays in `src/agda/agdai-cache.ts`,
  `src/session/register-agda-apply-edit.ts`, and
  `src/agda/version-support.ts` now all read from the single
  `agda-source-extensions.json` via
  `version-support.allSourceExtensionSuffixes()`. Adding a literate
  variant means editing one JSON file, not three call sites.
  New tests pin the JSON-data invariants (validator round-trip,
  blocked-flag regression guards, imported-fixity precedence
  values) so future edits to the JSON can't silently drop entries.

- **Configurable Agda CLI flags for `Cmd_load`** (#49) — `agda_load` and
  `agda_typecheck` accept a new `commandLineOptions` array that is passed
  through to Agda's `Cmd_load` `[String]` argument. Validated at the
  tool boundary (consistent with existing `profileOptions` semantics):
  invalid or session-conflicting flags (`--interaction*`, `--version`,
  `-V`, `-?`, etc.) are rejected with an `errorEnvelope` before the
  subprocess sees them. Case-sensitive matching for short flags
  (`-V` blocked, `-v` allowed); case-insensitive for long flags.
- **`.agda-mcp.json` project config** — a JSON config file at PROJECT_ROOT
  sets persistent `commandLineOptions` defaults. Loaded once per
  `agda_load` and cached by file mtime + size for repeated calls.
  UTF-8 BOMs are stripped; oversize files (>256 KiB) are refused with
  a warning rather than read into memory; unknown top-level keys produce
  a warning so typoed config keys (e.g. `commandlineoptions`) are not
  silently ignored.
- **`AGDA_MCP_DEFAULT_FLAGS` env var** — space-separated default flags
  alternative to the JSON config. Validated the same as file flags;
  invalid env entries surface as warnings on every load instead of
  silently corrupting the option list.
- **`agda_project_config` tool** — agent-facing introspection tool that
  returns the resolved project config (file flags, env flags, effective
  deduplicated flags) along with any validation warnings (unknown keys,
  invalid flag syntax, oversize file). Lets an agent confirm which flags
  will apply to subsequent loads without having to run a load first.
- **JSON schema for `.agda-mcp.json`** — published at
  `schemas/agda-mcp.schema.json` (and shipped with the npm package) for
  IDE autocompletion via the standard `$schema` field.
- **Project-config diagnostics on every load** — `agda_load`,
  `agda_typecheck`, `agda_reload`, `agda_apply_rename`,
  `agda_add_missing_clauses`, and every proof-action reload (give,
  refine, case_split, auto, solve, intro) now surface
  `LoadResult.projectConfigWarnings` either as structured tool
  diagnostics or as a `**Project-config warnings:**` markdown section,
  so an agent sees the failure inline with the load that consumed the
  bad config — not only when calling `agda_load` explicitly.
- **"Did you mean ...?" suggestions for typoed flags** — invalid
  command-line options now get a Levenshtein-matched hint pointing at
  the closest entry in `COMMON_AGDA_FLAGS`. `Werror` (forgot the
  dashes) → `Did you mean '--Werror'?`. Same treatment for typoed
  `.agda-mcp.json` keys: `commandlineoptions` (case typo) →
  `Did you mean 'commandLineOptions'?`. Conservative thresholds (≤2
  for flags, ≤3 case-insensitive for keys) avoid second-guessing real
  but obscure inputs.
- **`LoadResult.projectConfigWarnings`** — public load-result field
  so any tool surfacing a load result can render config warnings
  consistently. Centralises the wire format previously duplicated at
  each tool boundary.
- **Per-element validation of `commandLineOptions` arrays** — a
  config like `["--safe", 42, "--Werror"]` now keeps the two valid
  flags and emits one warning per offending entry (with index and
  type label: `commandLineOptions[1] is not a string (got number)`),
  instead of dropping the whole array on the first non-string.
- **Control-character + length defenses on flags** — a flag
  containing a newline / NUL / tab / DEL is now rejected with a
  `control character` error (would otherwise corrupt IOTCM
  transport, which serialises commands one-per-line). Flags longer
  than 1024 chars are rejected with a truncated-preview error; the
  longest real Agda flag is well under this and a multi-KB string
  is almost certainly an accidental paste of a binary blob.

### Fixed

- **Resource leak: timed-out commands no longer leave a zombie Agda
  process running.** `AgdaTransport.sendCommand` now calls
  `terminateAgdaProcess(proc)` from its timeout handler so the
  subprocess is reaped instead of abandoned. The new helper sends
  SIGTERM and escalates to SIGKILL after a 3 s grace window if the
  child ignored the first signal; the escalation timer is `unref()`'d
  so a wedged child never blocks Node shutdown.
- **Listener leak across respawn: stale `close`/`data` callbacks no
  longer reach the freshly spawned process's shared transport.**
  `spawnAgdaProcess` now returns a `detachListeners()` function held
  by the session and called from both the timeout-driven respawn
  path inside `ensureProcess` and from `destroy()`. `handleProcessClose`
  also takes the identity of the closing process and ignores
  late-arriving callbacks from a process that has already been
  replaced — a race that previously could null out the *current*
  process's `libraryRegistration` and `currentFile` mid-command.
- **`ensureProcess` no longer reuses a killed-but-not-yet-closed
  process.** It now checks `proc.killed` alongside `exitCode === null`
  (which can briefly be `null` after `proc.kill()` before the kernel
  reaps the child) and proactively frees the old AGDA_DIR
  registration before allocating a fresh one — the old close handler
  is detached at that point and would no longer release it.
- **`destroy()` now uses the same SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation as the
  timeout path AND awaits the subprocess's actual exit.** Returns
  `Promise<void>`; the `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` signal handlers in
  `src/index.ts` await it before calling `process.exit(0)`. Previously
  the unref'd SIGKILL escalation was truncated by the synchronous
  `process.exit`, so a SIGTERM-ignoring child could survive the MCP
  server's own shutdown.
- **`AgdaTransport.destroy()` unblocks any in-flight `sendCommand`.**
  Pre-fix, calling `session.destroy()` mid-command detached the proc
  listeners before termination, so the eventual `close` event never
  reached the emitter and the pending command would wait for its full
  per-command timeout (default 120 s) before observing the shutdown.
  The transport now emits an `"error"` on its shared emitter so the
  command rejects promptly.
- **`AgdaSession.sendCommand` rejects when the inline version
  preflight killed the subprocess.** The user's IOTCM envelope was
  built BEFORE this task ran (e.g. goal-operations bake `currentFile`
  and goal IDs in at call site), so forwarding it into a respawned
  Agda would either trip "No file loaded" on a fresh process or
  target stale interaction IDs. The command rejects up front with
  "Agda subprocess was replaced during version preflight; call
  agda_load before retrying." instead of writing the stale envelope
  into a dying or fresh process.
- **`getPhase()` no longer reports a killed process as
  `hasProcess: true`.**
- **`projectConfigDiagnostics()` mis-labelled `system`-source warnings
  as `config:`** — the binary `env` / `config` ternary swallowed the
  `system` source even though the diagnostic kind was correctly
  `project-config-system`. The visible message text now matches the
  kind via a `prefixForWarningSource()` mapping; the
  `agda_project_config` tool's inline duplicate of the same logic now
  routes through the shared formatter.
- **System-level config-read failures are now tagged `system`, not `file`**
  — `statSync` / `readFileSync` failures (permission denied, deletion
  race) are infrastructure problems, not "your config content is
  wrong". An agent can now distinguish `the disk says no` from `the
  JSON is malformed` by looking at the warning source.
- **`agda_effective_options` source attribution** — flags that appeared
  in BOTH `.agda-mcp.json` and `AGDA_MCP_DEFAULT_FLAGS` are partitioned
  at config-load time (`fileFlags` / `envFlags`) so
  `agda_effective_options` reports each source unambiguously,
  including the case where the same flag appears in both.
- **`-V` blocking case-sensitivity** — the previous lower-casing pass
  meant `-V` (Agda's short `--version`) and `-v` (verbosity) collapsed
  to the same key, blocking the verbosity flag too. Short flags now use
  case-sensitive matching (`-V`, `-?` blocked), long flags case-insensitive.

### Changed

- **`ProjectConfig` shape** — internal API change: `commandLineOptions`
  field replaced by separate `fileFlags` / `envFlags` arrays plus a
  `warnings` array of validation issues. External callers can use
  `effectiveProjectFlags(config)` to get the combined list.
- **Project-config merge centralised in `AgdaSession.load()`** — every
  caller of `session.load()` now picks up `.agda-mcp.json` and
  `AGDA_MCP_DEFAULT_FLAGS` defaults, not just `agda_load` and
  `agda_typecheck`. Previously `agda_apply_edit`'s post-edit reload,
  `agda_bulk_status`, and `analysis-tools.ts`'s revalidation bypassed
  the merge, producing inconsistent typechecking behavior under a
  shared project config. Validation warnings now ride back on
  `LoadResult.projectConfigWarnings` so any tool surfacing a load
  result can display them inline.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **False `ok-complete` on loads with source holes** — `agda_load` and
  `agda_load_no_metas` could report `ok-complete` when explicit hole markers
  (`{!!}`, `?`, `{! expr !}`) existed in the source but the Agda protocol
  under-reported goals (e.g. holes inside `abstract` blocks reported as
  invisible goals only). A gated source-level hole scan now detects these
  markers and prevents false-positive `ok-complete` classification.
- **`invisibleGoalCount` undercount** — when multiple `AllGoalsWarnings`
  display events occur during a single load, the invisible goal count is now
  preserved as the maximum across events (not the last event's count).
- **Strict-load enforcement** — `agda_load_no_metas` now forces `type-error`
  classification whenever any holes or metas remain (visible goals, invisible
  goals, or source-level hole markers). Previously it could succeed despite
  source holes when the protocol reported zero goals.

### Added

- **IOTCM protocol parity — invisible goal decoding** — invisible goals
  (unsolved metavariables) are now structurally decoded from the real `NamedMeta`
  wire format (`{name: string, range: Range}`), matching the official Agda
  Haskell `encodeTCM NamedMeta` instance across v2.7.0.1, v2.8.0, and master.
  They are exposed as `DecodedInvisibleGoal` entries (name + type) in
  `DecodedLoadDisplay`, instead of being discarded and kept as a count only.
- **Cross-version protocol reference** — added
  `tooling/protocol/data/official-cross-version-notes.json` documenting the
  stable JSON field mapping for `AllGoalsWarnings`, `InteractionId`, and
  `NamedMeta` across representative Agda versions, sourced from the official
  Agda Haskell sources.
- **New Agda fixtures** — `MixedHoleStyles.agda`, `HoleInStringComment.agda`,
  `AbstractHoleMultiple.agda`, `MixedVisibleInvisible.agda`,
  `PostulateAndHole.agda`, `NestedAbstractHole.agda`,
  `MultiPostulateComplete.agda`, `AbstractComplete.agda` — all registered in
  the fixture matrix for integration testing.
- **Protocol conformance stress tests** — new fixtures stress-testing edge
  cases: multiple holes in abstract blocks (invisible-goal-only reporting),
  mixed visible + invisible holes, postulate + hole coexistence, nested abstract
  modules with holes, multi-postulate completeness, and abstract-complete
  (no-hole abstract blocks).

### Changed

- **Classification consolidation** — removed dead `classifyParsedLoad()` helper
  and consolidated into a shared `classifyLoadResult()` function that accounts
  for protocol goals, invisible goals, and source-level hole markers in one
  place.
- **Strict-load classification simplification** — `runLoadNoMetas` classification
  now uses only `"ok-complete"` / `"type-error"` (removed unreachable
  `"ok-with-holes"` branch).

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`agda_session_snapshot`** — one-call agent introspection tool that returns
  the full session state: loaded file, phase, goal counts, completeness,
  staleness, and prioritised suggested next actions (#21)
- **`agda_goal_catalog`** — returns a structured catalog of all open goals in
  one call: goal ID, type, context entries with implicit flags, splittable
  variables, and per-goal action suggestions (`give`, `refine`, `case_split`,
  `auto`, `intro`) (#20)
- **`agda_tool_recommend`** — suggests likely next MCP tool calls based on the
  current semantic proof state, ordered by priority with rationale, pre-filled
  arguments, and blockers (#19)
- **`agda_cache_info`** — reports the `.agdai` cache layout for the loaded file,
  both the `_build/` separated path and the source-adjacent fallback
- **`agda_impact`** — answers "which files transitively import this one?",
  returning both direct and transitive dependents and dependencies; graph is
  rebuilt from disk each call so newly added files are visible without a
  server restart
- **`--help` / `--version` CLI flags** — running `agda-mcp-server --help` or
  `agda-mcp-server --version` now prints usage information and exits cleanly
  instead of starting the MCP server (#42)
- **Proof-action write-back** — `agda_give`, `agda_refine`, `agda_refine_exact`,
  `agda_intro`, `agda_auto`, `agda_case_split`, `agda_solve_one`, and
  `agda_solve_all` now persist edits to the source file and auto-reload by
  default (`writeToFile: true`); pass `writeToFile: false` for session-only
  behaviour
- **`agda_apply_edit`** — new tool for non-goal edits (imports, renames, typos)
  that performs a round-trip text substitution and reloads; bypasses the
  session-error gate so it can be used to repair a `type-error` state
- **Goal-ID diffs in reload diagnostics** — every reload response now includes
  `{solved, new, remaining}` goal-ID sets so agents can track goals across edits
  without re-identifying by type
- **Wall-clock timing (`elapsedMs`)** — all MCP tool responses carry an
  `elapsedMs` field on the envelope; tool summaries include elapsed time (e.g.
  "Loaded Foo.agda with classification ok-complete (42ms)")
- **Agda `--profile` support** — `agda_load` and `agda_typecheck` accept an
  optional `profileOptions` parameter; profiling output is collected from
  `DisplayInfo/Time` responses and returned in the tool payload
- **`forceRecompile` on `agda_load`** — escape hatch to bust the `.agdai` cache
  for the current file when stale interface files cause unexpected failures
- **Runtime Agda version detection** — `AgdaSession` auto-detects the installed
  Agda version on first process start via `Cmd_show_version` and exposes it via
  `getAgdaVersion()`; capabilities and file discovery are gated on the detected
  version
- **Version-gated file discovery** — `agda_list_modules` and
  `agda_search_definitions` now recognise literate Agda extensions
  (`.lagda.md`, `.lagda.rst`, `.lagda.org`, etc.) based on what the installed
  Agda version actually supports (#30, #31)
- **Literate Agda extraction for `agda_read_module`** — new `codeOnly` parameter
  strips prose and returns only Agda code blocks from all seven literate formats
  (`.lagda`, `.lagda.tex`, `.lagda.md`, `.lagda.typ`, `.lagda.rst`,
  `.lagda.org`, `.lagda.tree`); has no effect on plain `.agda` files (#32)
- **`agda_list_modules` pagination** — new `offset`, `limit`, and `pattern`
  parameters prevent token-budget overruns on large codebases; every response
  carries the unfiltered total module count; default page size 25
- **Manifest-derived output schemas** — `getToolSchemaEntry()` and
  `listToolSchemas()` expose Zod-derived field→type summaries for every
  registered tool, enabling agent-readable schema discovery (#18)
- **`invisibleGoalCount` in session state** — `AgdaSession` now persists the
  count of invisible goals from load results, surfaced via
  `getInvisibleGoalCount()` and wired into snapshot and catalog tools
- **Session provenance stamping** — every tool response includes
  `serverVersion` and (best-effort) `agdaVersion` in the provenance block so
  agents always know which toolchain produced a given response
- **Session-history tracking** — `agda_load` records `lastClassification` and
  `lastLoadedAt` and emits a `session-regression` diagnostic when a previously
  complete file regresses to `type-error`
- **`lastCheckedLine` on `agda_load`** — surfaces the earliest error line so
  agents can pinpoint where type-checking stopped on a failure; a
  `scope-check-extent` info diagnostic flags when `hasHoles` may be
  under-counted due to an early abort
- **`agda_metas` file attribution** — response now includes `loadedFile`,
  `errorsByFile`, and `warningsByFile` arrays; each group carries
  `ownedByLoadedFile` so callers can immediately distinguish errors in the
  loaded file from errors in transitive dependencies
- **Literate Agda test fixtures** — fixtures for all seven literate formats
  (`.lagda`, `.lagda.tex`, `.lagda.md`, `.lagda.rst`, `.lagda.org`,
  `.lagda.tree`, `.lagda.typ`) added to the fixture matrix with per-format
  minimum Agda version requirements; integration tests skip gracefully on
  older installs
- **Expanded fixture corpus** — 19 additional fixtures covering type errors,
  parse errors, missing imports, universe levels, `--with-K`, `--rewriting`,
  `--sized-types`, `--cubical`, `--cumulativity`, `--guardedness`, deep import
  chains, mutual recursion, and mixed holes/errors

### Fixed

- **`agda_typecheck` / `agda_load` session-state desync** — `agda_typecheck`
  now routes through the singleton `AgdaSession`; `agda_session_status` always
  reflects the most-recent typecheck (#39)
- **Query tools unavailable on type-error** — `agda_why_in_scope`,
  `agda_infer`, `agda_compute`, `agda_search_about`, and `agda_show_module` now
  return an `unavailable` result when the session's last load was a `type-error`,
  preventing incorrect happy-path payloads over a broken session state
- **`Cmd_constraints` version gating** — Agda 2.9.0 requires a `Rewrite`
  argument that earlier versions reject; `buildConstraintsCommand` now selects
  the correct wire shape based on the detected Agda version (≥ 2.9.0 uses
  rewrite-mode form; earlier uses the bare form)
- **`agda_session_snapshot` E2E coverage** — the tool was missing from the MCP
  e2e coverage fixture matrix and is now correctly tracked
- **Literate fenced-block extraction** — rewritten to track non-Agda blocks
  separately, preventing false matches when `` ```agda `` text appears inside
  other fenced blocks; all four delimited extractors now recover from
  unclosed blocks
- **Tree-format literate extraction** — fixed an off-by-one in `startLine`
  calculation when `\agda{` has code on the same line as the opening brace
- **`agda_tool_recommend` duplicate recommendations** — stale + type-error
  combined state no longer produces duplicate entries
- **Tool gates with `nextAction` recovery hint** — the `session-unavailable`
  error diagnostic now also emits a companion `recovery-hint` info diagnostic
  with `nextAction: "agda_load"`, giving agents a machine-readable recovery
  path

### Changed

- `agda_session_snapshot` and `agda_goal_catalog` surface explicit
  `starting`/`exiting` phase states, matching all other phase-aware tools
- Property-based test coverage expanded to bug-report bundles,
  completeness classification, tool envelope invariants, and literate
  extraction across all seven formats
- CI now installs Agda 2.6.4.3 (pinned) with recommended stdlib via
  `wenkokke/setup-agda@v2` and runs the full integration test suite on every
  push; Copilot coding agent also preconfigured with live Agda

### Security

- **Shell injection fix** — `agda --version` pre-flight now uses
  `execFileSync(bin, ["--version"], { shell: false })` instead of the former
  `execSync` string form, eliminating CWE-78 shell-command-injection exposure
  when `AGDA_BIN` or `AGDA_MCP_ROOT` contains shell metacharacters
- **Dependency security updates** — `hono` 4.12.8 → 4.12.12 (fixes middleware
  bypass, path traversal in SSG, IP restriction bypass, and cookie validation
  vulnerabilities); `@hono/node-server` 1.19.11 → 1.19.13; `vite` 8.0.3 →
  8.0.5

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **`Cmd_constraints` IOTCM protocol error** — the command was incorrectly sent with a `Normalised` rewrite argument that Agda cannot parse; it is now sent as a bare command
- **`Cmd_tokenHighlighting Remove` deleted source files** — the `Remove` flag tells Agda to delete the file at the given path after reading it; the server was passing `.agda` source file paths, causing silent source file deletion. The `remove` parameter has been removed from the tool interface
- **Concurrent IOTCM command serialization** — commands are now queued via a promise chain to prevent interleaved protocol responses
- **`Cmd_constraints` normalization for Agda 2.9.0** — GiveResult rendering updated for upstream protocol changes
- **Stale process cleanup** — session destroy now reliably resets mutable state
- **AGDA_DIR validation** — reuse stable AGDA_DIR when explicitly set via environment

### Changed

- **Test suite migrated from `node:test` to Vitest with TypeScript** (#27) — 93 test files converted from JS to TS with full type discipline; tests now import source directly instead of compiled `dist/`; `fast-check` upgraded to v4 via `@fast-check/vitest`
- Removed `linguist-detectable=false` overrides from `.gitattributes` — repo language stats now reflect the actual TypeScript codebase

### Security

- Path sandboxing hardened across file tools and symlink resolution
- Pinned CI actions, npm audit clean, tightened SECURITY.md

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-24

- strict load support via `agda_load_no_metas`
- process control tools for `Cmd_abort` and `Cmd_exit`
