# Phase 4 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | vitest ^4.1.2 |
| **Config file** | vitest.config.ts |
| **Quick run command** | `npx vitest run test/unit --reporter=dot` |
| **Full suite command** | `npm test` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~60s pure; QUEUE-04 gh-mirror tests must run dry-run/mocked (no live GitHub calls) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx vitest run test/unit --reporter=dot`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npm test`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite green
- **Max feedback latency:** 120 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| (filled during planning) | | | | | | | | | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] (filled during planning — see 04-RESEARCH.md "Validation Architecture" section)

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| (filled during planning — likely the live gh-mirror push, which must NOT be exercised in automated/autonomous runs) | | | |

*If none: "All phase behaviors have automated verification."*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] QUEUE-04 gh-mirror tests are dry-run/mocked (no live GitHub calls in CI/autonomous runs)
- [ ] Feedback latency < 120s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
