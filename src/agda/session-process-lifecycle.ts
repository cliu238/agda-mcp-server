// Process-lifecycle helpers for `AgdaSession`. Extracted from
// `session.ts` so that file can stay under the 500-line ceiling
// declared in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ("Module-size convention"). The
// pattern mirrors `session-load-impl.ts`: free functions that take
// an `AgdaSession` reference and mutate its module-internal state.
// External consumers should keep using the class methods on
// `AgdaSession` — these helpers are an implementation detail of
// process spawn / respawn / close / shutdown.
//
// Why this is a separate module:
//   - Process lifecycle is its own concern (spawn, detach, kill,
//     respawn-on-stale, shutdown) and clusters cleanly.
//   - `session.ts` also owns the command queue, version detection
//     glue, IOTCM builders, the load orchestrator, and a dozen
//     accessors. Bundling lifecycle in keeps pushing the file over
//     the limit on every change.
//   - The fields these helpers mutate (`proc`, `detachProcListeners`,
//     `libraryRegistration`, etc.) are declared module-internal in
//     `session.ts` and read by no external consumer — moving the
//     mutations here doesn't change the public surface.

/**
 * Predicate for "this proc handle is still usable". Three guards:
 *
 *   1. `exitCode === null` — proc has not exited normally.
 *      Strict equality because a 0 exit code is falsy but means
 *      "exited cleanly" and must NOT count as live.
 *   2. `!proc.signalCode` — proc was not terminated by a signal.
 *      Critical because Node leaves `exitCode === null` when a child
 *      dies from a signal and instead populates `signalCode` with
 *      the signal name; without this check, a child killed externally
 *      (so `.killed` is also false) but not yet reaped via the
 *      `close` event would be reported as live. See Copilot review
 *      comment on PR #56. Falsy check rather than `=== null` so a
 *      fake proc whose `signalCode` is `undefined` is treated as
 *      "no signal received" — matches the intent.
 *   3. `!proc.killed` — we did not just send it SIGTERM ourselves
 *      (e.g. from the per-command timeout in `AgdaTransport`).
